# httpd_assets_url - Set assets url (without trailing slash).
#
# Here is were css, images and js files will be retrieved from. This is
# normally "https://www.centos.org" in production and
# "https://www.dev.centos.org" in development. When we change the main site
# design all other sites based on it will be changed as well and there won't be
# necessary to maintain separated files. In order for this to work, origin
# domains must be specified in httpd_www_cors option.
#
# This variable should be defined in a high scope location (e.g., under
# `group_vars/all.yml`, or `group_vars/webistes.yml`) so all website-related
# playbooks you run can take advantage of it reducing the number of places you
# need to change.
# ===============================================================================
httpd_assets_url: "https://www.centos.org"


# ===============================================================================
# httpd_navbar - Set website navigation bar.
#
# The navigation bar is visible on the very top of each CentOS website, where
# the CentOS logo and the top-level-always-visible links are placed. The navbar
# can contain both links and menu of links so you can group them. Menus by
# default are hidden and are visible when the user clicks the item that has the
# arrow pointing down on right side.
#
# The navigation bar the httpd_navbar variable defines is re-used in different
# website templates (e.g., mailman, wordpress-theme).  For consistency, it must
# match the content the `_data/centos/navbar.yml` file provides in
# www.centos.org site.
#
# This variable should be defined in a high scope location (e.g., under
# `group_vars/all.yml`, or `group_vars/webistes.yml`) so all website-related
# playbooks you run can take advantage of it reducing the number of places you
# need to change.
#
# When you define link inside the navbar, use `httpd_assets_url` variable as
# much as possible to keep navigability among different environments (e.g.,
# www.dev.centos.org and www.centos.org).  See `httpd_assets_url` block in this
# file to know more.

# Blog theme configuration.
#
# Themes are being installed in accumulative way to avoid conflicts between
# different theme versions (e.g., because files were added or removed). You can
# switch from one theme version to another using the wordpress graphical user
# interface, after performing a live preview verification. As new themes are
# installed, older themes are available as backup mechanism.
#
# New theme releases can be found in:
# - https://gitlab.com/CentOS/artwork/centos-web/wordpress-theme-centos/-/releases
